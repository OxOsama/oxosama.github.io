# **CTF@CIT!**

Hello Everyone!<br>
I recently participated in the CTF@CIT, which was a really fun experience, and I managed to secure the 18th place with my team `L0ck8y7e` among other 950 teams around the world, As for me, I solved 11 challenges distributed among `MISC`, `Steganography`, `OSINT` and `Reverse`.

In this Write-up, I'll cover all of them except the two rev challenges, which I'll discuss in a separate write-up.

# **MISC**

## Robots

![Robots_image](/assets/images/Write-Ups/CTF@CIT2025/Robots_image.png)

At first, I went to discord ofcourse and searched for by the chall name but just found everyone's mocking messages that say `Beep boop` [it was a misleading distraction], so I went back to the chall's description and noticed the chall name.
It's very similar to the famous robots.txt file

Robots.txt is a simple text file placed at the root of a website (e.g., https://example.com/robots.txt) that tells web crawlers (like Googlebot or Bingbot) which pages or directories of the site they are allowed or disallowed to crawl.

So, why don't try it on our server (https://ctf.cyber-cit.club/robots.txt), and **Voilà**, we get this file content:
```js
# robots.txt generated on 2023-10-01

## Extremely Hard Challenge

Don't be fooled by its name, it's literally telling you the flag.

## Calculator

![Calculator_image](/assets/images/Write-Ups/CTF@CIT2025/Calculator_image.png)

It's a `.lua` file, Lua is a lightweight, fast scripting language, i opened the file in VScode and found this:

```lua
function calculate(num1,num2,operator)
    if operator == "+" then
        return num1 + num2
    elseif operator == "-" then
        return num1 - num2
    elseif operator == "*" then
        return num1 * num2
    elseif operator == "/" then
        if num2 == 0 then
            return "Error: Division by zero is not allowed."
        else
            return num1 / num2
        end
    else
        return "Error: Invalid operator."
    end
end

io.write("Enter the first number: ")
local input1 = io.read()
local number1 = tonumber(input1)
if not number1 then
    print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.")
    os.exit(1)
end

io.write("Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): ")
local operator = io.read()

io.write("Enter the second number: ")
local input2 = io.read()
local number2 = tonumber(input2)
if not number2 then
    print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.")
    os.exit(1)
end

local result = calculate(number1, number2, operator)

print("Result: " .. tostring(result))







































   	    		
	
     	  	  	
	
     	 	 	  
	
     				 		
	
     		 	   
	
     		  		 
	
     			 	  
	
      		 	  
	
     		   	 
	
     	 	 	  
	
      		    
	
      		 	  
	
      		   	
	
      		 	 	
	
     	  		  
	
     		   	 
	
     					 	
	
  




-- nope no flag here, keep looking :P
```

It's a typical simple calculator, that takes two numbers and an operation and prints the result, but something is odd, there are some unnecessary tabs and spaces at the end followed by a comment.

So, I opened it in an hex editor and found this:

![Calculator_hex_view](/assets/images/Write-Ups/CTF@CIT2025/Calculator_hex_view.png)


It's a combimation of `0x0A`, `0x09` and `0x20`, so I opened [Cyberchef and made this Recipe](https://cyberchef.org/#recipe=Find_/_Replace(%7B'option':'Regex','string':'0A090A20202'%7D,'%20',true,false,true,false)Find_/_Replace(%7B'option':'Regex','string':'20'%7D,'0',true,false,true,false)Find_/_Replace(%7B'option':'Regex','string':'09'%7D,'1',true,false,true,false)Find_/_Replace(%7B'option':'Regex','string':'%2000'%7D,'%20',true,false,true,false)From_Binary('Space',8)&input=MjAwOTIwMjAyMDIwMDkwOTBBMDkwQTIwMjAyMDIwMjAwOTIwMjAwOTIwMjAwOTBBMDkwQTIwMjAyMDIwMjAwOTIwMDkyMDA5MjAyMDBBMDkwQTIwMjAyMDIwMjAwOTA5MDkwOTIwMDkwOTBBMDkwQTIwMjAyMDIwMjAwOTA5MjAwOTIwMjAyMDBBMDkwQTIwMjAyMDIwMjAwOTA5MjAyMDA5MDkyMDBBMDkwQTIwMjAyMDIwMjAwOTA5MDkyMDA5MjAyMDBBMDkwQTIwMjAyMDIwMjAyMDA5MDkyMDA5MjAyMDBBMDkwQTIwMjAyMDIwMjAwOTA5MjAyMDIwMDkyMDBBMDkwQTIwMjAyMDIwMjAwOTIwMDkyMDA5MjAyMDBBMDkwQTIwMjAyMDIwMjAyMDA5MDkyMDIwMjAyMDBBMDkwQTIwMjAyMDIwMjAyMDA5MDkyMDA5MjAyMDBBMDkwQTIwMjAyMDIwMjAyMDA5MDkyMDIwMjAwOTBBMDkwQTIwMjAyMDIwMjAyMDA5MDkyMDA5MjAwOTBBMDkwQTIwMjAyMDIwMjAwOTIwMjAwOTA5MjAyMDBBMDkwQTIwMjAyMDIwMjAwOTA5MjAyMDIwMDkyMDBBMDkwQTIwMjAyMDIwMjAwOTA5MDkwOTA5MjAw) and decoded the flag.

## Select all squares that contain uhh...

![Select_all_squares_that_contain_uhh](/assets/images/Write-Ups/CTF@CIT2025/Select_all_squares_that_contain_uhh.png)

If you opened the link you will see that, it requests to click `WIN + R` and pastes the string `powershell.exe` followed by the code copied in your clipboard, so I saved the copied code into a `ps1` file and upoaded it to `Any.Run` sandbox.

![Capatcha](/assets/images/Write-Ups/CTF@CIT2025/Capatcha.png)

After running for `146 s`, I opened this [generated report](https://app.any.run/tasks/5cb359b6-25d3-4e0b-be5c-2e5ff45819c7), inside the dropped file section, we can see a text file named `flag.txt` which has the flag inside.

![dropped_file](/assets/images/Write-Ups/CTF@CIT2025/dropped_file.png)

## Malware Analysis

![Malware_Analysis](/assets/images/Write-Ups/CTF@CIT2025/Malware_Analysis.png)

This one is very straightforward, As a malware analyst, the first think I would do is to upload the sample to VT and see if it was seen before.

So, I submited it and **Voilà**, the flag is its first submitted sample name.

![VT_result](/assets/images/Write-Ups/CTF@CIT2025/VT.1.png)

Flag: <span style="color:#00FFFF;">**CIT{y6Z97OnNt79F}**</span>
***looks like some players are upset finding out the solution after the ctf is over (> <)***



# **Steganography**

## Sorry, you're NOT a sigma!

![Sorry_you're_NOT_a_sigma!](/assets/images/Write-Ups/CTF@CIT2025/Sorry_you're_NOT_a_sigma!.png)

Now, we are left with a video of a lion roaring, so I extracted its sound tracks using this [tool](https://www.video2edit.com/extract-tracks), and unsurprisingly, it has two sound tracks, one for the lion roaring and other unheard, so I downloaded the second one, converted to `.wav` then performed a `Spectral Analysis` on it, and this how it looked like.

![Spectral Analysis](/assets/images/Write-Ups/CTF@CIT2025/Spectral_Analysis.png)

The resulted curl command is responsible for:
- Connecting to `http://23.179.17.40:6969/roar` using `-s` for silent behaviour.
- Download a file in the `/tmp/roar` directory.
- Changing the permissions of the  downloaded file allowing it to be executed
- Finally executing the file.

I didn't care about all of this so I only download the file in my Windows-VM and submitted it to VT and generated this [report](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/f1ecf94fa5790e9fef10e062edfb5e649ed2292a69bcc61e27c5186f9159a672/behavior), at the end of the report inside the `Highlighted text` section, we can see our precious flag.

![Highlighted_text](/assets/images/Write-Ups/CTF@CIT2025/Highlighted_text.png)

Flag: <span style="color:#00FFFF;">**"CIT{wh3n_th3_l10n_sp34k5_y0u_l1st3n}"**</span>

## Queen's Gambit

![Queen's_Gambit](/assets/images/Write-Ups/CTF@CIT2025/Queen's_Gambit.png)

This one was very amusing, First I upload the image to this [stegano tool](https://stylesuxx.github.io/steganography/), to extract the hidden bits in it, and I was left with this:

![blured_elizabeth](/assets/images/Write-Ups/CTF@CIT2025/blured_elizabeth.jpg)

We now have the hidden data `a8 a7 a6 a5 b8 c7 b6 d5 e4 f5 g4 h5 c1 c2 c3 d2 e1 e2 e3`, but what does it mean?? After asking both `ChatGPT` and `DeepSeek`, I was left with nothing, all what they said was about it's very similar to the algebraic‐notation of chess-board squares, so I wrote this Python script to visualise them for me:

```py
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Input data
coords = [
    "a8", "a7", "a6", "a5",
    "b8", "c7", "b6",
    "d5", "e4", "f5", "g4", "h5",
    "c1", "c2", "c3", "d2", "e1", "e2", "e3"
]

# Split into color groups
blue = coords[:7]
red = coords[7:12]
green = coords[12:]

# Convert to x, y coordinates
def to_xy(lst):
    xs = [ord(c[0]) - ord('a') for c in lst]
    ys = [8 - int(c[1]) for c in lst]
    return xs, ys

bx, by = to_xy(blue)
rx, ry = to_xy(red)
gx, gy = to_xy(green)

# Plot
plt.figure(figsize=(4, 4))
plt.scatter(bx, by, s=200, marker='s', color='blue', label='P (1–7)')
plt.scatter(rx, ry, s=200, marker='s', color='red', label='W (8–12)')
plt.scatter(gx, gy, s=200, marker='s', color='green', label='N (13–19)')

plt.xticks(range(8), list("abcdefgh"))
plt.yticks(range(8), list("87654321"))
plt.grid(True)
plt.gca().invert_yaxis()
plt.gca().set_aspect(1)
plt.legend(loc='upper right')
plt.title("Colored Grid Based on Groups")
plt.show()
```

This is the final script after editing it many times to understand the meaning of the data we have, now we are left with this image:

![Figure_1](/assets/images/Write-Ups/CTF@CIT2025/Figure_1.png)

Flag: <span style="color:#00FFFF;">**CIT{PWN}**</span>


# **OSINT**

## No Country for Old Keys

![No_Country_for_Old_Keys](/assets/images/Write-Ups/CTF@CIT2025/No_Country_for_Old_Keys.png)

As a first step, we need to know who is `Anthony McConnolly`, so I used the following google dork `site:XXXXX.com "Anthony McConnolly"` on several websites until I finally found a match in github, so I opened his account and he only has one repo named `ai-web-browser`:

![github_account](/assets/images/Write-Ups/CTF@CIT2025/github_account.png)

Inside the repo, there are only 7 commits, inside the commits page, we see a commit named `removed my API key`, so we open it, and **Voilà**, here is our flag:

![commit](/assets/images/Write-Ups/CTF@CIT2025/commit.png)

Flag: <span style="color:#00FFFF;">**ap9gt04qtxcqfin9**</span>

## The Domain Always Resolves Twice

![The_Domain_Always_Resolves_Twice](/assets/images/Write-Ups/CTF@CIT2025/The_Domain_Always_Resolves_Twice.png)

During  my last search for `Anthony McConnolly`'s accounts on the social media, I have encountered his LinkedIn account, so by reviewing his posts, we can see this post where he talks about his favourite registrar

![LinkedIn_post](/assets/images/Write-Ups/CTF@CIT2025/LinkedIn_post.png)

So, now we can go to [WHOIS](https://www.whois.com/whois/ippsec.rocks) and search on the domain named `ippsec.rocks`, and our flag is now obvious.

![Whois_result](/assets/images/Write-Ups/CTF@CIT2025/Whois_result.png)

Flag: <span style="color:#00FFFF;">**GoDaddy**</span>
